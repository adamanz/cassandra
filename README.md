# Cassandra: An Intelligent Calendar Assistant

Cassandra is a specialized AI calendar assistant designed to help you manage your schedule efficiently. The application uses advanced natural language processing to find events and create new ones with minimal user input.

## Features

1. **Smart Calendar Search:** Find meetings with just a company name or keyword. The assistant intelligently expands search terms to match various formats (e.g., "sendblue" â†’ "SendBlue", "send-blue", "SendBlue Inc").

2. **Efficient Event Creation:** Create calendar events with natural language. Simply specify the date, time, title, and optional location.

3. **Schedule Management:** Get quick insights about your availability, conflicts, and upcoming meetings.

4. **Secure Authentication:** Built with Auth0 integration for secure access to your Google Calendar.

## Technical Highlights

- **Enhanced Search Capabilities:** Uses advanced name variation generation, intelligent time window expansion, and fuzzy matching to find events even with minimal input.

- **Integration with Google Calendar:** Securely connects to Google Calendar using Auth0's Token Vault feature.

- **Powered by Gemini AI:** Utilizes Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview model for fast, accurate responses.

- **Built with Modern Stack:** Next.js, LangChain, and LangGraph.js for a responsive, streaming experience.
